0,fm receiver it has none
1,"the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good but i was wrong !"
2,great video clip quality for a digital camera so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? ) the 2 0 megapixel one )
3,creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature
4,i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n ' t take weeks to figure out how to operate
5,scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models
6,"also , the lens cap design is flawed"
7,do n 't buy this player
8,"however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the ' zen micro ' has to offer"
9,"this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n ' t want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera"
10,"maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it"
11,"quite simply , the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time"
12,"it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment"
13,great features
14,a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy
15,its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ' ve had
16,"there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my perv machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance"
17,"little to no networking experience , just in case the automatic cd method has issues"
18,"for the hobbiest , it ' s probably a nice buy"
19,"difficult navigation i wo n ' t necessarily say difficult , but i do n ' t enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate"
20,fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket
21,and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow
22,the bass treble the sound detail is aw some
23,"by the way , it looks nice also"
24,"i love the features , the interface , the size ( the screen is a delight ) , the camera ( though i admit i ' m not much of a camera user so just a toy for me ) , the internet connectivity , the quality , etc"
25,"with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i ' ve had the following headaches"
26,this phone is one of the best i ' ve ever used
27,i know the saying is you get what you pay for but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this there is no excuse
28,the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use
29,5 the camera installed on this phone is awesome
30,"if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w the diaper genie"
31,this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start up from 4 down to 2
32,"i don ' t know if we ' ll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i ' m very happy not to have to buy those refills"
33,the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect
34,you have to wonder why creative can ' t get this right
35,will never purchase apex again
36,"all reviews i ' ve seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung )"
37,i ' ve had no problems w this phone
38,i never had a single problem
39,the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega pixel camera
40,"i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice"
41,the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed
42,"next , the big reason not to buy any norton product if there 's a problem with it , norton charges 30 to even tell them about it"
43,"this time , it started the installation process , then i left for work i think it will work i hope it will work"
44,some more manual control would have been nice
45,i love the bluetooth easy to use with a wireless abra headset
46,another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function
47,what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical
48,the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn ' t change it for the scroll wheel
49,"if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly 105 50 per minute and blame you for abusing your ipod"
50,3 ) user replaceable battery
51,"i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t zones never worked"
52,"great sound good interface replaceable , powerful battery good software wake up , sleep timers multiple play modes"
53,the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality
54,"2 the scroll button is n ' t the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select"
55,"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can ' t get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n ' t know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight )"
56,the digital zoom is crap
57,"after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee ' s product after calling their support they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful"
58,"i ' m in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen"
59,it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it
60,i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n ' t a big problem
61,the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet
62,i did it and it was worse the second time around unbelievable
63,"the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder"
64,"when you dial a number , you ' ll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct"
65,"aside from a 6mb built in phone memory , there ' s a 32mb mmc card that goes with it !"
66,the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use
67,"it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife )"
68,it holds plenty of songs
69,when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra it ' s that good !
70,i have had no problems with the phone
71,"i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window"
72,it has plenty of power
73,6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed
74,anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception
75,4 ) no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras
76,we keep the diaper champ in our daughter ' s nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers
77,we constantly got windows virtual memory low error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and or crashes
78,the battery life can ' t be very long let ' s not be greedy
79,plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad
80,the sound quality is very good
81,"i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can ' t tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail"
82,"battery life is about 1 4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive"
83,"the included headphones suck , so get your own"
84,"however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table )"
85,"they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great"
86,but canon never fails to amaze
87,the great and versatile ipod
88,"finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best"
89,"1 month , no problems , great phone i ' m very pleased with my 6610 phone"
90,8 connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth
91,"other than that , the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you ' re willing to hunt for it"
92,one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player
93,it ' s really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch
94,the light auto correction is awesome
95,4 the build is just right
96,it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point and shoot we ' ve ever tested
97,"before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality"
98,the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half
99,it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop
100,"i ' ve owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i ' ve been pleased with their performance"
101,it also does n ' t have voice activated dialing big minus ! !
102,battery life is good for a phone of this size
103,"these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable"
104,"however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all dosn ' t work at all in the car , for example"
105,the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application
106,we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems
107,"being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face"
108,i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty
109,"i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files this gives an average of around 60 65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me"
110,"it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer ( pent4 , 256 ram )"
111,"i tried to call norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non tech customer service ( tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of muzak ) or they have a 30 tech support number"
112,this is ridiculous
113,"besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !"
114,the dvd player just would ' t recognize them
115,this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another
116,avoid this product at all costs
117,"despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography"
118,"if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen"
119,"even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life !"
120,"there will be much erasing of text as , one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters"
121,setup in xp was instant and intuitive
122,utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list
123,the g3 looks like a work of art !
124,"after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md e828lp ' s and sennheiser mx 400 ' s , i find myself still using the creative ' s , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord"
125,the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on
126,"essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless"
127,"the ones i ' ve kept ( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router"
128,"i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product"
129,"overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it"
130,"the camera and video functionality is decent , i can 't see myself wasting my time with it , but some people will"
131,the collet for the 1 4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out
132,"so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work"
133,i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player
134,"even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with mac settings , etc"
135,"the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have"
136,"i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny"
137,the battery life is not that of the casio ' s but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you ' ve got
138,"i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great"
139,and it holds so much music and audio files
140,"the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it"
141,"typically , the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others"
142,"i loved this product when i first got it great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n ' t the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood"
143,it ' s a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus
144,you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network
145,four megapixels is great
146,the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it you can ' t avoid that
147,this is one of the best purchases we made
148,"ability to play most discs i tried dvd , vcd , dvd r , audio cd and it played all"
149,overall i like it
150,but you can download some really good ones like pac man or mafia wars
151,"it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well designed , doesn ' t look to ostentatious while i ' m walking around with it"
152,very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures
153,it will read and play all cd audio disc
154,"sure , it ' s a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much"
155,the phones are awesome
156,"sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder"
157,most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy
158,"also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you"
159,"kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that"
160,the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed
161,hard drive screws up occasionally
162,"my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can ' t create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating )"
163,video output stopped working
164,can ' t say whether i rec ' d an updated model but it will not read dvd rw ' s or vcd ' s for me
165,"after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift"
166,the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use
167,"have tried to contact apex via e mail ( customerservice apexdigital com ) , but the e mail address is not valid"
168,one neat thing i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms no problem for the camera rooms looked like they had ample lighting
169,the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function
170,"it holds almost a week ' s worth of diapers , and you don ' t need expensive refills any kitchen bags work"
171,the blue backlight is pretty cool
172,"for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better"
173,"the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods"
174,"second , it is incredibly easy to use"
175,"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots"
176,the remote is a little hard to understand
177,"if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now"
178,"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance ' s stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )"
179,"speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks !"
180,"the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to"
181,"very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you ' re going to get at this price"
182,its quiet
183,always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped
184,the sound is just fine
185,"to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player"
186,the in ital setup of the router was simple
187,the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch
188,"but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won ' t function"
189,"the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus"
190,it ' s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features
191,"it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot"
192,"but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything"
193,"the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own )"
194,apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players
195,all in all though i ' m very happy with my new mp3 player
196,5 excelent software package
197,"basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help"
198,it is a very amazing product
199,"being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills"
200,it ' s rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven ' t had to do it yet of course
201,"( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd ' s would n ' t play and they were new ones !"
202,"the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service"
203,"they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware"
204,i purchased two of these beauties
205,the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad
206,"the scroll button is sort of annoying to push a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal"
207,setup is totally breeze and linksys ' s web site is pretty easy to navigate
208,"i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles"
209,"operation it ' s like bmw ' s i drive it does it ' s job , but has the most unintuitive , overly layered interface"
210,it has great incredibility
211,it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted maybe 10 seconds of wait
212,i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since
213,seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection
214,"overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity"
215,this thing seriously is a good player though
216,"of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i ' ve been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents"
217,i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality
218,"so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly"
219,pros 1 speed 2 signal strength 3 advanced configuration options
220,"since then , i have not found one major problem with it"
221,"but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n ' t anticipate any problems with it"
222,unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type
223,this is really a nice diaper pail
224,it ' s the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you ' ll have an idea of the front profile ! )
225,we got two phones for the t mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but can not be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use
226,"its stable , so a curious toddler can ' t easily tip it over"
227,"i don ' t know what ' s happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage"
228,"as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep"
229,then sorting the files is easy as pie
230,"the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line"
231,even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast
232,"surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available"
233,"but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful it ' s a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying"
234,"despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !"
235,pc cable is too expensive 50 for a usb cable ?
236,this is really a no brain er
237,i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n ' t had any problems
238,"well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze"
239,another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty 500 price tag and get a quality camera
240,"as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine"
241,the panorama setting is unbelievable !
242,picture quality ' s great for still and video with sound
243,stay away from this junk
244,"fact is , it could n ' t be easier to use"
245,i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling humming buzzing sound while music was played
246,"yes , the features are numerous"
247,"huge storage space even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing"
248,"transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy"
249,the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
250,"although i find it more convenient to use 1 touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing"
251,i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone
252,it ain ' t cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells whistles it definitely ain ' t pretty
253,"also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up"
254,"it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel"
255,"first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed"
256,"third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer"
257,"anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago"
258,because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos !
259,that ' s a rare and valuable feature
260,but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2 1 mp camera
261,the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260
262,"when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture !"
263,"also , you can store data on it , which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n ' t bother , this is a much better buy"
264,the only thing i ' m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing
265,a bit disappoint on that !
266,"this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device"
267,in my table the m12v has been a real champ
268,i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode )
269,it was a symantec error
270,"it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ?"
271,and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play
272,"i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product !"
273,this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway
274,it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! )
275,because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery
276,"i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders"
277,i highly recommend a nokia 6610
278,"operating its many features is easy and often obvious i ' m no annie levitt ' s , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store"
279,"ok , not quite everything but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it"
280,high quality video and pictures rock !
281,"for a specific location , i still think its a great phone"
282,was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac
283,but those 2 come up every time
284,"3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card"
285,"the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do"
286,"while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones"
287,"this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want"
288,we ' ve never experienced odor from the pail
289,"oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet"
290,it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd
291,"the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use"
292,"a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always"
293,"even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track"
294,i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright
295,"i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you"
296,"the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily"
297,"when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry !"
298,it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera
299,fits well in hand in trouser pockets
300,there is no odor and it is very easy to use
301,i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement
302,the volume level of the phone is not all that good
303,there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board
304,the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients
305,i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd ' s transferred
306,this holds alot and does not take up alot of space
307,"as for the zen micro cons i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front"
308,the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 11b speeds and not 802 11g
309,1 pictures wo n ' t transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable
310,you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly
311,excellent sound quality
312,the fm radio is cool
313,the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot
314,the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd ' s or tapes !
315,"the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least"
316,i got it working fast enough
317,yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy
318,the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting
319,"great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price"
320,all the good reviews for the sd500 are true
321,"they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping 15 to handle and ship a cd ? and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails"
322,"powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on"
323,"the cut outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel"
324,4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging
325,"remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons"
326,it still smelled
327,so for the money it costs for one of those top of the line models i ' ve got a good router a nice table to put it in i like that
328,"i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities"
329,everything shines of quality
330,this linksys router does it for the right price
331,i treat the battery well and it has lasted
332,"we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome"
333,very simple and painless
334,you don ' t need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a special edition to get black ! sound awesome ! batteries removable replaceable
335,user interface the software is simple and straight forward
336,so far i haven ' t had so much complaints except that i still haven ' t mastered how to scandisk when using internet security
337,"also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn ' t detract from performance"
338,this did n ' t bother me too much because it ' s still a decent size
339,5 the zen does not have a stop button !
340,"i wanted standard memory expansion ( cf cards ) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing ( for kayaking )"
341,i would put the hitachi up with the best !
342,"if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else"
343,"first of all , i ' ve never been big on earbuds they ' re just not that comfortable"
344,"mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs"
345,"after consulting with creative ' s customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me 40 , since it ' s past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty )"
346,also the battery life isn ' t great but it ' s sufficient for my needs
347,the supplied headphones are hands down better than the mediocre ipod buds
348,"but if you ' ve used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !"
349,the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly
350,"i have to say i ' m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds"
351,in a week of use i ' ve never had to reboot the router
352,i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
353,we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it ' s great
354,"digital zoom is clear too say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then just try not to shake the camera at all and you ' ll still get a clear good quality picture"
355,"it wo n ' t play 80 of my movies , which are all store bough ten"
356,it is hot enough to be annoying
357,transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle
358,i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience
359,"this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people"
360,the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned
361,the battery life leaves a lot to be desired
362,they take excellent macro shots as well
363,"the menus are easy to scroll through they are laid out naturally , and make sense"
364,it ' s good
365,"i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift"
366,"i ' d recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software hardware"
367,turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? i have to check again ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date
368,"i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems"
369,"customer service awful listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier"
370,the quality is significant and you ' ll be very happy from saving time and the headache
371,it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black
372,"the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it ' s a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies"
373,"i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money"
374,c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer
375,"when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive"
376,saw the hitachi on amazon com with their 25 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out
377,"last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this"
378,"games not really important , but exist ant"
379,"i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium ion battery , an ac dc power adapter , a usb 2 0 cable , a belt clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick start guide , and creative mediasource software"
380,canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out
381,"the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours not too long at all ! ) once you ' ve downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist e g covers of songs ) , etc"
382,"both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going"
383,2 it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use
384,the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance
385,"first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be unlike apple with the ipod"
386,"i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it"
387,i ' m very pleased with my zx so here ' s a quick review
388,the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited
389,"the scroll wheel is better than the ipod ' s as well , in that you do n ' t risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly just a small nudge of the finger and you ' re there"
390,"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear"
391,"i can not find a carrier for this phone i like , end up just tossing it in my purse"
392,"there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn ' t any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ"
393,"mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i ' m giving it 4 , not 5 stars )"
394,"just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc"
395,they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger
396,i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual
397,"the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great"
398,"sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i ' m able to fix that using the photoshop 6 0 adjust levels function not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though"
399,now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will !
400,good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro
401,"few month ago , it ' s very popular among my community"
402,i liked this one enough to buy another
403,"i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a customer priority id number"
404,i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason
405,i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool
406,"initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera"
407,"you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3 player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! ! ) and also you can carry it in your pocket )"
408,"the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate"
409,"if you ' ve been listening to cd ' s in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop off in sound quality may take some getting used to"
410,proven canon built quality and lens
411,the electronic speed control is not doing it ' s job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will
412,the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company
413,memory storage seemingly boundless
414,"the s100 ' s image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack"
415,the arm band is fantastic and it doesn ' t budge even at the gym
416,this is a wonderful camera
417,it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important
418,i love this product !
419,i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad
420,i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again
421,"other than that , i think it is the best router for the money"
422,"features click wheel to navigate ability to work with windows or mac optional back lighting ( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds ) ability to download pda info automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer"
423,i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection
424,"great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others )"
425,the customer support is pathetic
426,and the video quality is amazing
427,this product is too fragile for normal use
428,software downloads on the site crashed my pc
429,the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have
430,"other than the fact that one can ' t delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind numbingly simple to use"
431,"great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous"
432,"4 my idea was that it was an all in one , and that theory once again proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the other than phone functionalists , you ' ll be disappointed if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine but don ' t expect to get much done"
433,my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn ' t even fit a smaller sized garbage bag
434,i am very pleased so far
435,"i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point"
436,it does n ' t smell like burning plastic when you open the drive
437,"all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price"
438,it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless
439,"so far , we ' ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine"
440,it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light
441,im at full capacity ! ! ! ! i called syman tic and they said they don ' t know why but i should get tech ' s support at 35 hr to help ! ! i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up !
442,"ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have n ' t even gotten to all of them yet"
443,"transferring music is a breeze i don ' t subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes"
444,"the installation , set up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well"
445,buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non working computer
446,however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times
447,"i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro"
448,i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better
449,"it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds"
450,"it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx"
451,"the ss body is wonderful , feels high quality"
452,"but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture"
453,my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 monitor
454,it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003
455,"i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone"
456,"if you do n ' t have tags , it ' ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders"
457,"also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers"
458,"great picture quality in automatic mode , quality is great"
459,zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player
460,"nokia was my first non flip phone , and i ' m glad i decided to go with them"
461,"i ' m currently using a sony vaio s 150 ( which i bought at the end of this past august ) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system in fact , i ' ve taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely"
462,"the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want"
463,"since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement )"
464,i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer
465,") creative , inc the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box , then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices"
466,the product also leaves a faint smell in the room
467,looks and shape i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool
468,"the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users"
469,"it is amazingly small , it ' s hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera"
470,we just recently had to buy another roll of bags so 6 00 for a year of bags can ' t beat that ! !
471,"with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it"
472,"the karma is only 5 more , it ' s small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog"
473,the menu is easy to use and understand
474,got a system error problem 30 days after purchase
475,player has a problem with dual layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2
476,range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography
477,i do n ' t always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags
478,"i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i ' ve found the free speak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone"
479,"2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information"
480,"it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a normal compression mode and , it has the 3x zoom"
481,im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )
482,apex does n ' t answer the phone
483,"after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc creative ' s online support was no help at all"
484,it will not replace your high end 35mm slr but it ' s a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots
485,everything else about the camera is great
486,"of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me several working days later when they promise only one their suggestions were completely worthless"
487,it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk
488,2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations
489,"the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer"
490,my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor
491,but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability
492,another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world
493,i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly
494,"the white led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery"
495,even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer
496,mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download
497,well the champ has survived it ' s first year with our son and it is great ! !
498,"all in all , i believe this is arguably the best non slr digital camera on the market"
499,"during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so"
500,"i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy"
501,it ' s as though nokia has segregated 90 of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 for the day to day use
502,i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini
503,"this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit"
504,norton ' s memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low
505,it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping
506,"whether you ' re taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you ' ll be glad you had the fm radio"
507,"the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so"
508,no vibration !
509,"yes , the 1 800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem"
510,the size of the camera is perfect
511,"audio formats supports both mp3 , wma and yeah , wav too"
512,"you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed"
513,1 small
514,and i must say this mp3 is very cool
515,"compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck"
516,"transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad"
517,"8 perhaps inspired by the canon ' s factory white correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets"
518,"the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11 18m speed that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard"
519,"moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it ' s so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go"
520,seriously ! i love it !
521,i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support
522,"as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale"
523,i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system )
524,"i thought i ' d have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well"
525,"unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming"
526,"i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i 75 , far superior to at 38 t ' s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route"
527,less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer
528,the height adjustment works well not perfect
529,"nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www crazy cellphone com"
530,"this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways"
531,"recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m 4m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately"
532,"the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen"
533,"for example , in auto mode you can ' t use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that"
534,"i was worried about what the sound quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound"
535,this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ' ll use all the time
536,all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well
537,"battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so"
538,everything i wanted ! the apple ipod has become one of the most sought after electronic gadgets and for good reason
539,both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together
540,the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution
541,no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require !
542,"the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera"
543,i highly recommend it
544,i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes no crashes or problems
545,the lcd screen was very large and readable
546,each battery lasts about 10 11 hours
547,"i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use"
548,it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it
549,absolutely no problems with this router
550,"handsfree future is good , but not too exciting"
551,"solid , high quality construction"
552,the storage capacity is great for me
553,the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it
554,the fact that has an open source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion
555,"while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with alerts every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off"
556,the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well
557,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased"
558,"the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid"
559,"the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods"
560,"many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks"
561,the setup was very easy
562,it was also the most appealing
563,"the only reason for not giving it 5 stars the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6 8 hours at most"
564,it ' s easy enough to pop it open to see what song you ' re listening to
565,the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95 of all photos taken by a beginner
566,"the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes"
567,"bright , visible screen"
568,"the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable )"
569,its not a perfect system but its a very good one
570,sharper pictures
571,"putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download"
572,"perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag ( from amazon ) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways"
573,tough as nails
574,2 ) scroll button switch
575,"all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price"
576,"as it turns out , this is an awesome camera !"
577,the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use
578,"so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all"
579,the top did not fit well into the unit ( felt defective )
580,"all the cool features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5"
581,i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy
582,"another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i ' d scanned before buying"
583,the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n ' t in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage
584,"overall though , i ' m very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod )"
585,"unfortunately , this digital moment capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted"
586,included creative software is pretty poor
587,"the two times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two piece shutter like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off"
588,"they are a royal pain to install , and don ' t function properly once finally installed if you can install them at all"
589,when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 ) is blocked by the lens
590,"my op ion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has excellent range , holds a teddy connection , ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now"
591,"if you haven ' t noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer"
592,gets nice sound too
593,zennx ' s replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod
594,"as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage"
595,"i ' m staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n ' t nearly as good as t mobile ' s , the clarity of their reception is exceptional"
596,the only complaint i have is that the 1 4 collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 4 bits
597,the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up
598,"there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !"
599,especially the bluetooth server meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again
600,the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days
601,"so , don ' t buy this or upgrade"
602,"two it has a removeable rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re !"
603,this product is absolutely not ready for release
604,the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking
605,"after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window"
606,can ' t get easier than that !
607,i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision
608,only slight negatives i ' ve had so far is that i haven ' t been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet
609,extremely convenient
610,"this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can ' t go wrong"
611,i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar
612,it is made of plastic
613,the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots
614,i think it 's great
615,"also , with one click you can help train your spam killer"
616,it ' s faster than wmp
617,my son tried it and he too couldn ' t change the speed without an assist
618,i am very pleased with my purchase
619,the panorama modes are wonderful
620,so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here ' s the link to firmware updates http www suavest com forum6 html
621,versatile and stylish
622,5 the price is right
623,"i ' m sure i don ' t use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it !"
624,i love this player
625,i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason
626,i would recommend this camera unequivocally !
627,"the major reasons i didn ' t give it a five are one , i didn ' t think the fine adjustment worked well"
628,"as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , ' creative mediasource organizer '"
629,"in any case , navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders"
630,"unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually"
631,this router has soft start and runs smooth and true
632,in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control
633,the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged
634,i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase
635,"they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department"
636,the battery is removable
637,they didn ' t know what the problem could be
638,but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers
639,3 ) the case hides the display you have to open it to see what you are doing
640,"it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor !"
641,"touch ups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct"
642,the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line
643,canon ' s optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better
644,"otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player"
645,neat feature for self timer allows you to record two different warnings
646,the biggest problem is the installation
647,"i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention"
648,"for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised"
649,"4 the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking"
650,"on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again"
651,"the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks"
652,amazon is awesome !
653,"3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software"
654,for the price i don ' t think you can beat it
655,3 the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface
656,"the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192 256 kbps without variable bit rates )"
657,this camera is truely superb
658,"our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price"
659,"sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products"
660,"the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit ' s size in doing so"
661,"unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation"
662,clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! ! !
663,size bigger than the ipod
664,i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic
665,i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures
666,i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept
667,this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can ' t be stopped
668,looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors
669,"the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market"
670,"probably a great phone overall , and perhaps mine just has bugs"
671,"the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx ' s green backlight did"
672,i ' ve now had the camera for two months and i ' m even more pleased with it
673,"best camera ever from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything"
674,the sound is very nice
675,they 're easy to use
676,other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won ' t disappoint any already established nokia phone fans
677,"then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely"
678,i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons
679,"i have n ' t messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box"
680,"firewire usb2 0 for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync"
681,the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice
682,the vibrate setting is loud !
683,"i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper and i needed to be able to use wma files"
684,accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive
685,advanced photo bugs will find more creative control than imaginable
686,i ' ve tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered
687,"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera"
688,"when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh , so light"
689,"the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub par"
690,"after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket"
691,"it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well"
692,do not buy any home version of norton anything
693,but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design
694,also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls
695,this thing is trash
696,"still , that ' s enough time that i ' m still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative ' s over hyped promises"
697,"weak points touch pad design could be better volume control controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built in volume control will do the trick"
698,"also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 tv )"
699,"a little weighty ( 9 ounces no biggie ) , but otherwise fine"
700,i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn ' t for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone
701,"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n ' t moving , the photos were awesome"
702,"after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck"
703,the battery has a long life
704,it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes
705,i thought the software was decent enough it was n ' t complicated to learn at all
706,"i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5 5 stars ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! ( digital zoom only though ) but still ( my old one can ' t do that you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip )"
707,do n ' t buy this player
708,limitations not a lot of original accessories like the ipod
709,"the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up"
710,moving on to sound department it delivers !
711,cons difficult to open to change bag twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out leaving dirty diapers all over the floor
712,"styling ergonomics the keys are small , which generally doesn ' t bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little ' braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn must be paid when dialing"
713,"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in auto mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !"
714,player works and looks great if you can get the dvd ' s to play
715,"the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people"
716,the setup and transfer process was cake for me
717,"it ' s not my first choice in cameras ,"
718,"but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ?"
719,"( ) like most soho routers , it has nearly non existant logging"
720,images taken indoor were n 't so clear
721,"while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player"
722,the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory
723,i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n ' t do it !
724,"the sound quality is excellent ( and i ' m fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that )"
725,"the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there ' s plenty of neat tie ins"
726,"this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift"
727,this is a fantastic tool to use
728,learning how to use it will not take very long
729,"on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software !"
730,3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything
731,"the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot"
732,"over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !"
733,i decided to save the and opted for the zen xtra and i was not disappointed
734,but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version
735,i purchased this phone for just 50 and there is no end to what i can do with it
736,i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards
737,this one is particularly bothersome allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another
738,you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu
739,the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read
740,the file ripping transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use
741,"i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3"
742,this is quite simply the best you can ask for
743,"i ' m giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be good but if you ' re getting a nokia , don ' t get this one"
744,great quality picture and features
745,"it ' s too bad , though , that !"
746,"i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don ' t have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i ' ve had my eye on for a while"
747,"everything , so far , has worked flawlessly"
748,i ' ve had it for about a week now and have to say it ' s one of the best purchases i ' ve ever made
749,"the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack"
750,the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately
751,"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage"
752,"the keypad is a decent size , but the power on off key is small and difficult to press"
753,don ' t worry this player rocks
